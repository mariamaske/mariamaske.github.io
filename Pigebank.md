		<h2>Recommendations for further analysis</h2>
	</header>
<ul>
					<li>Top three factors that lead to clients leaving: The top three factors are active membership, gender and age. Therefore  PIG E. Bank should focus on clients, who fullfill these factors.

</li>
					<li>Activity: They could create a bonus or loyalty programm where clients get points for being active that they can redeem for bonuses. 
</li>
					<li>Age: They could give people under 40 special discounts or interest rates to retain these clients. </li>
     <li>Gender: They can find out which financial topics are particularly interesting for women and build a specific program based on them in order to lose fewer women and gain more clients.</li>
</ul>
