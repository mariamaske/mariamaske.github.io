<h2>Recommendations for further analysis</h2>
<ul>
					<li>Collection of further data, especially for the Sub Sahara and Middle East and North Africa regions, in order to close the data gaps here.</li>
					<li>Investigate more deeply why the overall happiness score for South Asia has fallen so much in the last three years.</li>
					<li>And it would also be interesting to see to what extent the happiness score per country also differs by gender or age.</li>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<ul>
<li>We don't have data for every year for every country since many countries don't do the survey annualy. We have especially for the year 2022 many missing values.</li>
<li>Therefore our analysis may not be as accurate and could be slightly biased due to the circumstance that most missing values stem from the region Sub Sahara and Middle east and North Africa.</li>
</ul>
